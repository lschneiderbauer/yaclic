= Yet Another Calculator

Goal is a simple and intuitive cli-calculator, where symbols can be as easily used as numbers. Cause of writing such a calculator again is, that there exists just the "super-dumb-simple" ones and the "heavily-armed" ones (or at least I didn't find anything between).

So that's my (not finished of course) solution. It constists more or less of an extended ruby-shell, which does the parsing etc.
