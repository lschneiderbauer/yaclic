= Yaclic - Yet Another Cli Calculator

Yaclic is a simple and intuitive cli-calculator, where symbols can be as easily used as numbers. Cause of writing such a calculator again is, that there exists just the "super-dumb-simple" ones and the "heavily-armed" ones (or at least I didn't find anything between).
So that's my solution (wip).
It constists more or less of an extended ruby-shell.

For detailed information such as features or examples have a look at its man page and/or the project's webpage.
